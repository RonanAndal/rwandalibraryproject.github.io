RCS’s mission is to empower rural communities in Rwanda through providing access to literacy
and education through libraries, bridging the educational gap, and bringing knowledge to the
heart of rural Rwanda.

With 83% of the population living in rural areas, access to reading and other educational
materials remains a challenge for kids and adults alike in the rural communities. RCS is
committed to providing opportunities and bridge the knowledge access gap to make a change to
the underserved rural communities. We believe that education has the power to transform lives,
break cycles of poverty, and create a brighter future for generations to come. Therefore, our goal
is to build at least 1 library in each of 30 districts(states) of Rwanda. This will provide
opportunities for kids to have access to books, computers, tutoring and other educational
materials after school. Since some households do not have access to electricity, these libraries
will be a place with electric lights where kids can do their homework after school.

Our first library, Inzozi z’Abato (Little Ones’ Dreams) Library, is built in Sangaza, sector
Ngoma District, eastern province of Rwanda. This is the first library not just in Sangaza sector
but in the whole Ngoma district (this district has 14 sectors). The library is close to a local school
with more than 700 students with limited to no academic resources. The goal is to provide library
services and access to educational materials to the local kids both in school and not in school and
hopefully make some impact in other sectors in Ngoma district.

The vision of the library is to be more than just a building with books; we want it to be a
dynamic learning center, where kids can explore their interests, engage in intellectual
discussions, spark creativity, and get inspired.
